# Logos and icons repository
In this repository you can find all the icons of Doors. You caqn contribute if you can work with svg files or use them for app programming.

## doors_logos
Here you can find the official Doors logo in various types. Please be aware of the exact uses when and where, which version of the logo must be used.
Generally, we almost never use the icon but mostly the logo. The icon consists only of the main Doors icon, whereas the logo contains the text as well. We use the icon only to refer to the start menu or if there really is no space at all. Anywhere else, please use the logo.
Also, please do add new colors of our logo. Use the provided three versions of the logo only and in corresponding situations.

### Blue
Blue is the default color of Doors. Use this on light backgrounds.

### White
White is the secondary color of Doors. Use it on darker backgrounds.

### Light blue
Light blue is the rather rarely used color of Doors. Use it on pure black backgrounds only (for example our bootanimation).

## app_icons
In this folders, there are all third party app icons to provide a uniform experience with white icons even on the start screen of Doors.

## system_icons
In this folder, all the system icons used in various places can be found.
